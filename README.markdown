remi.org Screencasts
====================

Here be the source code associated with [http://remi.org](http://remi.org) screencasts.

Not all screencasts have source code but I'm going to start to be more 
diligent about sharing the code from screencasts I release!

Most screencast source code will be pushed to this project as new *branches*, not just new directories.  That's because, when I create a screencast, I often create it as it's own git repository.  Those repositories are easy for me to push up to github as new branches and they can have their own history.

This may change in the future ... we'll see how it goes!
